                    My resume is available here on the web site. I have a standard PDF version
                    and a more interesting JSON version. I use some simple jQuery to convert the
                    JSON resume into a web page version too! I wrote the JSON resume by hand, I 
                    did not use any of the resume builders out there.

                    I have some of my photography posted on Flickr. I have thousands more
                    photos that I still have to filter through and post-process.
